### Collaborate - Startup Idea for TO-DO Lists & Tasks

## Elevator Pitch
- So often in our lives, whether on our own or when working with others, we find it hard to keep our responsibilities in order.
- We try to maintain a list in our head and end up forgetting something important.
- When working with a team, we lose track of all the current tasks being worked on and don't know what needs to be done.
- The solution to each of these dilemmas and many more can be described with one word: collaborate.
- Collaborate is a product that enables one to record tasks and check them off once they're done.
- It also encourages organization with the ability to group tasks together into lists.
- Lists that can be shared across a team to ensure collaboration and transparency.
- As soon as you choose to collaborate and organize yourself, what was stress will be replaced with fulfillment and satisfaction.
